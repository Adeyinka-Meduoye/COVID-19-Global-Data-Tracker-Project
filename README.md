# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis project that tracks global COVID-19 trends (cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations) across countries and time.  
The notebook cleans, processes, analyzes, and visualizes real-world COVID-19 data, generating insights and visual reports.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run / View the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Adeyinka-Meduoye/COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker-Project.git

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter

3. Open the notebook:
   jupyter notebook COVID19_Global_Data_Tracker.ipynb

4. Run all cells **top-to-bottom**.

   * The notebook automatically downloads the dataset from [Our World in Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv).
   * Edit the `COUNTRIES` list at the top of the notebook to customize the analysis.

5. Export results (optional):

   * Use `File ‚Üí Save and Export As ‚Üí PDF` in Jupyter/VS Code.
   * Or save plots and tables via the optional export cells.

## üìä Insights & Reflections

* COVID-19 trends differ sharply across regions; some countries experienced multiple large waves while others saw smaller but steady increases.
* Vaccination rollouts varied significantly, with wealthier nations reaching high coverage faster.
* Case Fatality Ratios (CFR) highlight reporting differences and healthcare disparities.
* Data quality depends on each country‚Äôs reporting standards; anomalies and sudden spikes often indicate reporting adjustments, not actual outbreaks.
